            A Presentation Is...
      </p>

      <p>
            A presentation is a means of communication that can be adapted 
            to various speaking situations, such as talking to a group,
            addressing a meeting or briefing a team.
      </p>
      <p>
            A presentation can also be used as a broad term that 
            encompasses other ‘speaking engagements’ such as making
             a speech at a wedding, or getting a point across in a video conference.
      </p>
        <p>
                To be effective, step-by-step preparation and the method and 
                means of presenting the information should be carefully considered. 
        </p>
        <p>
                A presentation requires you to get a message across to the
                 listeners and will often contain a 'persuasive' element. 
                 It may, for example, be a talk about the positive work of
                  your organisation, what you could offer an employer,
                   or why you should receive additional funding for a project.

      <p>While you usually can get away with the default slide
           size for most presentations, you may need to adjust 
           it for larger presentations on weirdly sized displays.
            If you need to do that, here's how.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
                In the top-left corner, choose "File."
        </li>
        <li>Select "Page Setup."
               </li>
        <li>
                Type the height and width of the background you'd like, and click "OK."
                
        </li>
        <li>A dialogue box will appear. Click "OK" again.
                Your background is resized!</li>

      <p>
            Often, it's much easier to edit your PowerPoint
             template before you start -- this way, you don't have 
             design each slide by hand. Here's how you do that.
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                    Select "Themes" in the top navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
                    In the far right, click "Edit Master," then "Slide Master."       
           </li>
            <li>
                    Make any changes you like, then click "Close Master."
                     All current and future slides in that presentation will use that template.

            Many people underestimate the influence of typeface, 
            but choosing the right font is important --
             the perception of your font type could influence your 
             audience's impression of you. The right font is an opportunity
              to convey consistent brand personality and professionalism.
      </P>
      <p>Some fonts are seen as clean and professional,
           but this doesn't mean they're boring. A common mistake
            is thinking your font isn't "exciting" enough, which 
            could lead you to choose a font that distracts from your overall message.</p>
            <img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Powerpoint-creative-tips-font.png?width=247&name=Powerpoint-creative-tips-font.png">      
      <p>
            That said, you can still use fun and eccentric fonts
             -- in moderation. Offsetting a fun font or large 
             letters with something more professional can create
              an engaging presentation. Above all, be sure you're 
              consistent so your presentation looks the same 
              throughout each slide, so your audience doesn't 
              become distracted by too many disparate fonts.

    <p>
            Having properly aligned objects on your slide is the
             key to making it look polished and professional. 
             You can manually try to line up your images ... 
             but we all know how that typically works out. 
             You're trying to make sure all of your objects 
             hang out in the middle of your slide, but when 
             you drag them there, it still doesn't look quite right.
              Get rid of your guessing game and let PowerPoint work its magic with this trick.
    </p>
      <h2>How to align multiple objects:</h2>
      <ul>
            <li>
                    Select all objects by holding down "Shift" and clicking on all of them.

            </li>
            <li>
                    Select "Arrange" in the top options bar, then choose "Align or Distribute."

    <article>
            Format menus allow you to do fine adjustments that
             otherwise seem impossible. To do this, right click on 
             an object and select the "Format" option. Here, you 
             can fine-tune shadows, adjust shape measurements, 
             create reflections, and much more. The menu that will pop up looks like this:

            <br> Although the main options can be found on PowerPoint’s format toolbars,
              look for complete control in the format window menu. 
              Other examples of options available include:
             <ul>
                    <li>
                            Adjusting text inside a shape.

                    <li>
                            Creating a natural perspective shadow behind an object.
                           
                           
                   </li>
                    <li>

    <article>
      <p>
            Many users don’t realize how flexible PowerPoint’s 
            shape tools have become. In combination with the 
            expanded format options released by Microsoft in 2010,
             the potential for good design with shapes is readily
             available. PowerPoint provides the user with a bunch 
             of great shape options beyond the traditional rectangle,
              oval, and rounded rectangle patterns, unlike even
               professional design programs like Adobe Creative Suite or Quark.
      </p>

      <p>
            Today’s shapes include a highly functional Smart 
            Shapes function, which enables you to create 
            diagrams and flow charts in no time. These tools 
            are especially valuable when you consider that 
            PowerPoint is a visual medium. Paragraphing and 
            bullet lists are boring -- you can use shapes to help express your message more clearly.

            Besides creating custom shapes in your presentation, 
            you can also use PowerPoint to crop existing images 
            into new shapes. Here's how you do that:
        
            <ul>
                    <li>
                            Click on the image and select "Format" in the options bar.
                            
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Choose "Crop," then "Mask to Shape," and then choose your desired shape. Ta-da! Custom-shaped photos.

    <article>
      <p>In most presentation situations, there will be both a 
          presenter’s screen and the main projected display 
          for your presentation. PowerPoint has a great tool
           called Presenter View, which can be found in the 
           "Slide Show" tab of PowerPoint 2010 (or 2011 for Mac).
            Included in the Presenter View is an area for notes,
             a timer/clock, and a presentation display.</p>
             <img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-405263686-png/Screen_Shot_2013-12-05_at_2.07.31_PM.png?width=669&name=Screen_Shot_2013-12-05_at_2.07.31_PM.png">   
      
          <p>For many presenters, this tool can help unify their 
              spoken presentation and their visual aid. 
              You never want to make the PowerPoint seem 
              like a stack of notes that you use a crutch.
               Use the Presenter View option to help create a more natural presentation.</p>
          <p>
                Pro Tip: At the start of the presentation, 
                you should also hit CTRL + H to make the cursor disappear.
                 Hitting the "A" key will bring it back if you need it!
          </p>
          <p>
                With style, design, and presentation processes
                 under your belt, you can do a lot more with 
                 PowerPoint than just presentations for your clients. 
                 PowerPoint and similar slide applications are flexible
                  tools that should not be forgotten.
